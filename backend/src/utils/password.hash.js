// .hash and .compare are bycrypt functions from their library package
// hash is respnsible for hashing our passwords using bycropt hashing algorithm
// compare is for comparing user input of passwrd and their hashed version
// SALT_ROUNDS is a bcrypt concept called salt in which bcrypt adds random chars in strings randomly before password hashing
// Rounds = 12 is the count of how many times the salt should iterate the hashing algorithm will run internally
// the iteration for 12 is 2 to the 12th power exponent
