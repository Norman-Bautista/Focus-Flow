# **FocusFlow**

*A customizable Pomodoro + AI-powered productivity tracker*

---

## 📌 Overview

**FocusFlow** is a productivity web app designed to help users focus, avoid burnout, and build consistency in their work or study habits.

It combines:

✅ **Customizable Pomodoro timers**

✅ **Streak & cycle tracking**

✅ **AI-driven insights & reminders**

… to give users a clear view of their productivity while keeping balance in mind.

## 🎯 Motivation

The **Pomodoro Technique** helps many people stay productive and fight distractions — but not everyone works best in the same rhythm. Some prefer deep work sessions, while others need frequent breaks to avoid burnout.

With **FocusFlow**, users can:

- Tailor their **focus/break times** to match personal work styles.
- Track **cycles and streaks** to celebrate progress.
- Get **AI-powered summaries and reminders** to stay balanced and avoid overworking.

This project also serves as a **fullstack learning playground**, where I explore:

- Modern web development with **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
- **AI microservices** using Python + FastAPI.
- Integration with **DeepSeek API + LangChain** for AI-powered insights.
